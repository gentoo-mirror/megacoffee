# Kallithea versions before 0.3.6 are vulnerable to privilege escalation
# in Mercurial (CVE-2018-1000132).
# Note that Kallithea 0.3.6 continues to use a vulnerable Mercurial version
# (<4.5.1) but attempts to mitigate the issue.
# Upgrade ASAP (updates were already published on 6 Mar 2018 for Mercurial
# and 4 Nov 2018 for additional mitigation in Kallithea):
